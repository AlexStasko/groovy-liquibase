We're pleased to announce that the Liquibase Groovy DSL is now a part of the
Liquibase organization.  I will continue to maintain the code, but bringing this
project into the larger Liquibase family will help keep all things Liquibase
together in one place. The new home for the Liquibase Groovy DSL is 
https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-groovy-dsl

I'll update existing issues in this repository as they get addressed, but new
issues should be reported in the new repository.
